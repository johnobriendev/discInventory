This is an inventory application project built with Express.js. This will eventually be used as the API and admin view for a Disc Golf Ecommerce store I will be building. Right now the application is used to update a MongoDB database which stores Discs, Manufacturers, Disc Types, and Disc Instances (copies of a disc). The data structure will later allow clients to filter through the discs based on various properties (manufacturer, type, speed, glide, turn, fade, plastic, and weight).
